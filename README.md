# Fractional Integration Custom Theory

A Custom Theory for the mobile game [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/), the API and samples that helped create this come from [here](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk)
To see the theory in game enter this link after pressing the '+' icon in the Custom Theory tab: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gen1Code/Fractional-Integration/main/FI.js

The CT is based on [Fractional Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus#Fractional_integrals), this is a way to calculate the continuous amount of functions between a function and its integral.
