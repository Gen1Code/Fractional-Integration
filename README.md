# Fractional Integration Custom Theory

A Custom Theory for the mobile game [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/), the API and samples that helped create this come from [here](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk)

The CT is based on [Fractional Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus#Fractional_integrals), this is a way to calculate the continuous amount of functions between a function and its integral.

Fractional Integration is now an Offcical CT in the game! You can find it in the Custom Theory tab.
